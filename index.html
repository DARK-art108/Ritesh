I am Sayak (সায়ক) Paul. This is my personal website and it contains my blog posts, coordinates, interviews, etc. Know more about me from [here](https://sayak.dev/about/).

This site is built with [fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages), an easy to use blogging platform with extra features for Jupyter Notebooks.

My external articles and other publishing engagements (like books, liveProjects, etc.) are listed [here](https://sayak.dev/authoring/). Decks
from my speaking engagements are listed [here](https://sayak.dev/talksseminarsworkshops/). Interviews are [here](https://sayak.dev/interviews/).

# News

- New work with [Pin-Yu Chen](http://www.pinyuchen.com/) (IBM Research): [Vision Transformers are Robust Learners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.07581).
- New work with [Siddha Ganju](https://sidgan.github.io/siddhaganju) (NVIDIA): [Flood Segmentation on Sentinel-1 SAR
  Imagery with Semi-Supervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.08369). This work is based on our winning solution
  ([first runners-up](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1U4JTAYChV6PHwDA87gd2FJ04843YA6bN/view?usp=sharing)) submitted to
  [this competition](https://nasa-impact.github.io/etci2021/) organized by the NASA Impact team. We also
  made it to four NeurIPS 2021 workshops: AI for Science: Mind the Gaps, Tackling Climate Change with Machine
  Learning, Women in ML, and Machine Learning and the Physical Sciences
- [Masked image modeling with Autoencoders](https://keras.io/examples/vision/masked_image_modeling/) (joint
  work with [Aritra Roy Gosthipaty](https://twitter.com/arig23498))
- New project: [Point cloud segmentation in the wild](https://github.com/soumik12345/point-cloud-segmentation). We provide
  an implementation of PointNet in TensorFlow for segmenting 3D point clouds along with pre-trained models. Our training scripts are fully
  compatible with TPUs allowing you to experiment faster. This is a joint work with [Soumik Rakshit](https://github.com/soumik12345).
- New post from the GCP blog: CI/CD for Machine Learning - [Part I](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/developers-practitioners/model-training-cicd-system-part-i),
  [Part II](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/developers-practitioners/model-training-cicd-system-part-ii) (joint work with
  [Chansung Park](https://github.com/deep-diver)).

To know about my projects, please refer to [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/sayakpaul). 

Apart from the following blog posts, I try to contribute to other platforms in the form of writing. Please refer [here](https://sayak.dev/authoring/)
for more details.
